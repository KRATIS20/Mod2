                <h2>JK Rowling</h2>
                <p>
                    JK Rowling first conceived the idea about a young wizard on a delayed train travelling to King’s Cross Station. She scribbled her thoughts on pieces of scrap paper, gradually developing the story while raising her daughter as an unemployed 
                  single mother living on welfare benefits. Five years later, her finished manuscript of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was rejected by 12 publishers before finally getting picked up by Bloomsbury Publishing.

                <h2>Stephen King</h2>
                <p>
                    The master of horror has penned over 90 stories throughout his career, most of which have been a definitive success. But the going wasn’t always easy for King. Raising a family with his wife Tabitha, who is also a writer, the pair could 
                  barely make ends meet. When he wasn’t working as a teacher, King worked odd jobs at a laundromat, and as a gas station attendant and a janitor to keep a roof over his family’s heads. His first novel Carrie, which tells the story of a troubled teen with telekinetic powers, 
                  was rejected 30 times before finally getting published, eventually becoming one of the best-selling novels of all time.

                <h2>James Dyson</h2>
                <p>
                    Britain's richest man has taken the world by storm with his inventions. However, Dyson’s schooling is not what you’d expect from a world-renowned inventor. Indeed, Dyson was inclined towards the arts as a student and studied furniture design at the Royal College of Art in London.
                  But his career path would take a turn one day after becoming frustrated with his home vacuum. After breaking it apart and identifying a design flaw in the product, Dyson set out to create what would become a market-changing invention: the first bagless vacuum cleaner.
